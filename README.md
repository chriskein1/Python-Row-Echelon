# Python-Row-Echelon
### By Chris Keiningham

Python Project to reduce a given matrix to Row-Echelon Form / Reduced Row-Echelon Form by using Gaussian / Gauss-Jordan Elimination
- As a Python notebook
- Going from Row Echelon Form to Reduced Row Echelon Form is made as an option for the Gauss Elimination function
- Printing the output is also made as an option

- Currently np arrays are treated as int, and therefore will truncate
