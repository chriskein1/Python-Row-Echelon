# Python-Row-Echelon
### By Chris Keiningham

Python Project to reduce a given matrix to Row-Echelon Form / Reduced Row-Echelon Form by using Gaussian / Gauss-Jordan Elimination
- Linear Algebra project
- Made as a Python notebook, including sample outputs
- Options to continue Elementary Row Operations to Reduced Row-Echelon Form and print each step are included as parameters in the gaussElimination function
